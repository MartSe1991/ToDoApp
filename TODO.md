- Easy: Empty list component (Clipboard icon)
- Easy: Automatically close the modal once a new list or element is added
- Medium: Set Menu component to work like a BurgerMenu (use LinkedIn menu as a reference). For this you will need:

  - a state in you App component to manage the menu visibility
  - a button on the ActiveList component to toggle the menu visibility. This button is only visible on mobile
  - a way to dismiss the menu. Either a close button or even better, clicking the area of the screen that is outside of the menu
  - when you open the page, the menu should be hidden by default

- Medium-Hard: Ability to modify existing entries
